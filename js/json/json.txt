What is JSON?
	JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
	JSON is a lightweight data interchange format becasue it doesn't have tags.
	We can share the JSON data to and from frontend to middleware.
	JSON is language independent. Why because it doesn't have tags and it is just text based file.
	JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand.
How the JSON format evaluates to JavaScript object?
	The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.		
	Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.
JSON Syntax Rules are:
	Data is in name/value pairs
	Data is separated by commas
	Curly braces hold objects
	Square brackets hold arrays
How data is stored in json?
	Data is stored in the key and value format.
	JSON data is written as name/value pairs, just like JavaScript object properties.
	A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value.
How to write JSON Objects
	JSON objects are written inside curly braces.
	Just like in JavaScript, objects can contain multiple name/value pairs.
how to write JSON Arrays?
	JSON arrays are written inside square brackets.
	Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain objects
How to Convert a JSON Text to a JavaScript Object.
	A common use of JSON is to read data from a web server, and display the data in a web page.
	For simplicity, this can be demonstrated using a string as input.
	First, create a JavaScript string containing JSON syntax.
